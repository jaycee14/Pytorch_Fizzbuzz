# Pytorch_Fizzbuzz
Recreation (overkill!) of Fizzbuzz in Pytorch

## Rationale

I wanted a small self contained project to help my understanding of Pytorch.
Joel Grus's [excellent blog post](https://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/) was the source of this idea and is highly worth a read. I've even borrowed some of his functions.

The classic [Fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) problem can be solved imperically in a few lines of code so creating a neural network is a total overkill but its still a very interesting small project when learning the details of a designing a network, deploying to a GPU and a chance to dig into the basics. 

It's also still powerful to show a pattern being learnt with data alone.
